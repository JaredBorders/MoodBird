## MoodBird
MoodBird is an iOS app that pulls tweets from twitter via their RESTful API and uses CoreML3 to predict the sentiment for these given tweets. The ML model I created was trained via CreateML with data provided by the LondonAppBrewery. 

## Motivation
MoodBird was created to explore CoreML3 and Twitter's API

## Tech/framework used
CoreML3 - SwiftyJSON - Twitter's Standard RESTful API - Twitter Framework: Swifter by Matt Donnelly

## Features
Machine learning and language processing

## Installation
Download newest version of Xcode from the app store and replace my free standard twitter API keys with your own.

## Reference

## How to use?
After building and running in Xcode, type in a keyword of your choosing and the UI will respond with a number representative of the sentiment (i.e. -100 - 100).
